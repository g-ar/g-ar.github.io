Previously, the settings were stored in the router itself, but after the incident it was no longer connecting to the ppp server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called the ISP, and the router's configuration was changed by the support guy and since he's familiar only with windoze, I had to reboot it to windows xp (which I no longer use, only linux based OS now). Now, in order to connect to the internet, the username/password needs to be given in the dial-up prompt for the broadband connection (pppoe). But, for some weird reason, DNS was working, but no ping reply from any sites!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to try in linux mint, and thought of using pppoeconf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's straight-forward, for my ISP's connection the default settings worked. The only information which I needed to change was the username/password&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, ping replies were okay, but the DNS look up was not working now. After tinkering around with the files in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/ppp&lt;/tt&gt; and reading some man pages related to ppp, I discovered an info referring to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/resolv.conf&lt;/tt&gt; file. But, there was no such file in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc&lt;/tt&gt; by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I copied the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/ppp/resolv.conf&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprise again, it was still not working. Then I tried &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;strace nslookup google.com&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere near the end of the output, I found &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;open("/etc/resolv.conf",&lt;/span&gt; O_RDONLY) = &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt; EACCES (Permission denied)&lt;/tt&gt;. So, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sudo chmod 0644 /etc/resolv.conf&lt;/tt&gt;, and rebooted the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything worked fine after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: Actually, we need not worry about configuring from the terminal at all. With network manager already there, we just need to go to "network connections"-&amp;gt;"DSL"  in the menu, and add our connection id/passwd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>broadband</category><category>linux</category><category>mathjax</category><category>pppoe</category><category>strace</category><guid>https://g-ar.github.io/posts/configuring-broadband-connection-using-pppoeconf/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2012 17:21:48 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
