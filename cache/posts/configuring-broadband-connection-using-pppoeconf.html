<p>It all started when the lightning struck and disrupted the internet service. Previously, the settings were stored in the router itself, but after the incident it was no longer connecting to the ppp server.</p>
<p>I called the ISP, and the router's configuration was changed by the support guy and since he's familiar only with windoze, I had to reboot it to windows xp (which I no longer use, only linux based OS now). Now, in order to connect to the internet, the username/password needs to be given in the dial-up prompt for the broadband connection (pppoe). But, for some weird reason, DNS was working, but no ping reply from any sites!</p>
<p>So I decided to try in linux mint, and thought of using pppoeconf.</p>
<p>It's straight-forward, for my ISP's connection the default settings worked. The only information which I needed to change was the username/password</p>
<p>To my surprise, ping replies were okay, but the DNS look up was not working now. After tinkering around with the files in <tt class="docutils literal">/etc/ppp</tt> and reading some man pages related to ppp, I discovered an info referring to <tt class="docutils literal">/etc/resolv.conf</tt> file. But, there was no such file in <tt class="docutils literal">/etc</tt> by default.</p>
<p>So, I copied the <tt class="docutils literal">/etc/ppp/resolv.conf</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">/etc</tt></p>
<p>Surprise again, it was still not working. Then I tried <tt class="docutils literal">strace nslookup google.com</tt></p>
<p>Somewhere near the end of the output, I found <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">open(&quot;/etc/resolv.conf&quot;,</span> O_RDONLY) = <span class="pre">-1</span> EACCES (Permission denied)</tt>. So, <tt class="docutils literal">sudo chmod 0644 /etc/resolv.conf</tt>, and rebooted the system.</p>
<p>Everything worked fine after that.</p>
<p>Update: Actually, we need not worry about configuring from the terminal at all. With network manager already there, we just need to go to &quot;network connections&quot;-&gt;&quot;DSL&quot;  in the menu, and add our connection id/passwd.</p>
