Probability, computation and programming are what I like.

These are the tools used for my math problems:

- `Sagemath <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_, the best free Computer Algebra System out there.

- `J <http://www.jsoftware.com/>`_, an array programming language.

- `GNU <http://gcc.gnu.org/>`_ Compiler Collection, available by default in most linux distros.

- `Experimental mathematician's toolkit <http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/arprec-2.2.18.tar.gz>`_ by David H. Bailey and others.

- `FriCAS <http://fricas.sourceforge.net/>`_, another CAS, which has some very good sequence guessing routines missing in Sage.

Don't believe or trust any "research" where the experimental data and code are not in the public domain.
